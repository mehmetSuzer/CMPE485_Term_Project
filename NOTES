Technical Challenge: Simulation of a high number of rigid body objects

We will simulate a war scene with the followings:
    1- a destructible castle 
    2- cannons
    3- particle effects (explosion, blood)
    4- soldiers combatting

We will build a destructible castle with thousands of bricks.
Cannons will be facing to the building and will fire cannon balls periodically.
Particle effects like smoke, explosion, and fire will be displayed when the projectiles are shot.
High number of soldiers will be present in the battlefield. 

Parameters:
    1- number and size of bricks 
    2- dimensions of the castle
    3- number of cannons
    4- whether particle effects are active or not
    5- number of soldiers
    6- whether soldiers disappear when they die or not
    7- whether bricks disappear when they displaced from their original position or not

This is the overall idea that we want to experiment. 
Final product may be slightly different, but we will try to implement all of them.
We will monitor FPS, the load on CPU and GPU, and the memory usage.
